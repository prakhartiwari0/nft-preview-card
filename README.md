## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to make a project with assets. I learnt some css properties and techniques to add various effects. I also practically used my skills and learnt how to write less code by using same classes on elements that have the same properties. 

### Continued development

I need to learn css in depth, and practice a lot more. I also have to learn css grid concept.

### Useful resources
